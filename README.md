The Code in this Repository includes the Experiment Code for my 2021 Electronic Engineering Final Year Project

spectro.py states the code written for the creation of Log-Mel Spectrogram of an arbitrary Audio File. The audio file processed is a personal recording "Untitled.m4a"

Lineargradientprediction.py concludes the code for the data creation, model creations and model training of Experiment 1 of the Paper

"Multipletimestepbasedprediction.py" concludes the code for the data creation, model creations and model training of Experiment 2 of the Paper

When either is run, the program will ask for a raw input to decide whether the DNN or RNN network is to be trained and tested
